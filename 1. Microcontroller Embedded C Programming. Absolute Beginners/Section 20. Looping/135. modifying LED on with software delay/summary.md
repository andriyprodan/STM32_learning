# Exercise
- Modify the LED ON program into LED toggle program by creating a software delay between LED on and LED off
- LED should continuously toggle with certain time delay forever.

# Delay in program
- Software delay. Using loop statements
- Hardware delay. Using hardware peripherals such as timers

## Software time delay
- To introduce software delay, you should make the processor busy in a software loop doing nothing
- This method is not an accurate method to obtain the desired time delay
- The processor will keep wasting the execution cycles until a certain delay is met
