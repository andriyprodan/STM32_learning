# Representation of decimal numbers in C
- A Decimal Number containse a decimal point. 125.55 is a decimal number (a real number).
- If you are workin g with numbers that have a fractional part or in case you are using integers that don't fit into a long data type, then we can use floating-point representation.

## Why do we need floating point representation?
- To store a too-small number in memory
    **For example**: charge of an electron is $1.60217662 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs
- To store a too big number in memory
    distance between earth and andromed galaxy is $2.3651826 \times 10^{19}$ meters
